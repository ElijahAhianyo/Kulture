#Getting Started

This tutorial will show you how you can get started with ASP.NET vNext in Sublime Text 3. After completing this tutorial you will be familiar with how to use Sublime vNext and its primary features.

The first thing we will do is grab the samples. Using your favorite git client clone the repo at [ASP.NET vNext Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home)

    git clone https://github.com/aspnet/Home.git

If you are on mac, clone this repo

    git clone https://github.com/shirhatti/Home.git

Let's go ahead and open the included HelloMvc sample in Sublime. In Sublime, click on `File -> Open Folder` and navigate to the `Home\Samples\HelloMvc` to open it up.

  > Note: In Sublime for Mac use the `File -> Open` command

Since we just grabbed this from source control there are NuGet packages which this project requires that are missing. To restore the NuGet packages

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + P` to bring up the command palette
- Type `Run K Commands` and hit Enter (Return)
- Type `kpm restore` and hit Enter (Return)

You should see a Terminal/Powershell window launch and execute your commands.

Now, let's go ahead and tell Sublime to use `vNext` as the build system. To do this, click `Tools -> Build System -> vNext`

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + B` or `F7` to build projects

You should be able to see the output of your build in the output window towards the bottom of your screen. At this point your code should have built successfully.

Now let's see what the experience looks like if there is an error in your .cs file. Introduce an error in the Startup.cs file and try building again. You should now see errors in the output window. You can navigate through the errors as follows

- `F4` takes you to the next error
- `Shft + F4` takes you to the previous error

When an error has focus it will be highlighted in the build results and your cursor will be taken to the line and column where the error was reported.

After we resolve all the errors we have introduced, let us try and run the application

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + P` to bring up the command palette
- Type `Run K Commands` and hit Enter (Return)
- Type `k web` and hit Enter (Return)

You should see a Terminal/Powershell window launch and start running your server. You can navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your favorite browser you view the website.

  > This will fail on a Mac today if you don't have KestrelHTTPServer installed. I'm working to update this guide

We also have JSON Schema validation. Let's try it out. Open up *project.json*. Let's remove the first `{` after `dependencies`

- Press `Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + P` to bring up the command palette
- Type `Validate JSON Schema` and hit Enter (Return)

You should be able to see the result of your operation in bottom left of the status bar

You can try playing around with adding/removing attributes to your *project.json* to see if it still verifies against the schema
